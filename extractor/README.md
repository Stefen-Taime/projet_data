# extractor module
#### Problems Statement

Generally, this script should do the following ...
1. create the directory `downloads` if it doesn't exist
2. download the files one by one.
3. split out the filename from the uri, so the file keeps its 
   original filename.
4. Each file is a `zip`, extract the `csv` from the `zip` and delete
the `zip` file.
